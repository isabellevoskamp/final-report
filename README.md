## General information
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The purpose of my research is to examine the relationship between the language used in online reviews and the resulting sentiment. The popularity of online reviews has become ubiquitous in the digital age, influencing consumer decisions, and shaping public thinking. Understanding the language patterns that contribute to sentiment in reviews is of great interest to companies, policymakers, and researchers alike.

In the study, we use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze a diverse corpus of online reviews across different domains. Using various sentiment analysis tools, we seek to uncover the linguistic nuances that characterize positive, negative, and neutral sentiments in the reviews. The research delves deeper into the contextual factors that influence the expression of sentiments.

The results of this research aim to contribute valuable insights to fields ranging from marketing to consumer behavior to computational linguistics.

## Research question
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How does language in online reviews contribute to sentiment?

## Hypothesis
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Language variations in online customer reviews affect credibility and sentiment, thus influencing consumer decision making. If the language is perceived as credible it will have a positive impact on consumer decision making

## Method
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The study uses an existing dataset of online reviews from various industries, such as e-commerce, hospitality and services. The choice of this dataset is critical to ensure a representative sample that includes different product types, industries and review platforms. Within the study, tokenization is applied to divide reviews into words or phrases, which forms the basis for further analysis.

Various sentiment analysis techniques are employed to capture the sophisticated sentiments within online reviews. Here, both machine learning models, such as sentiment classifiers, and lexicon-based methods, such as sentiment lexicons, are used to increase accuracy and completeness. Natural language processing (NLP) techniques are applied for feature extraction, identifying the relevant linguistic elements that contribute to the expression of sentiments.

The results are interpreted in the context of the research question, highlighting specific linguistic elements that play a role in the expression of sentiments. In doing so, insight is provided into how certain words, phrases or writing styles affect the overall sentiment conveyed in online reviews.

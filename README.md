## General information
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In recent years, the rise of online reviews has played a role in shaping consumer choices and influencing the reputation of products and services. Online reviews have become widespread in the digital age and impact customers' choices and ways of thinking. 

This research paper will focus on specific component of online reviews, namely the influence of specific words in forming positive or negative sentiments. The purpose of my research is to examine the relationship between the use of language in online reviews and the resulting sentiment. The question under discussion is: \textit{how do specific words in online movie reviews contribute to positive or negative sentiments?} The platform where I will examine movie reviews is The Internet Movie Database (IMDb).

## Research question
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How does language in online reviews contribute to sentiment?

## Hypothesis
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I expect that differences in the language used in online customer reviews evoke different sentiments and will influence consumers in making decisions. This expectation is based on the idea that the language used in online reviews directly affects customers' feelings, influencing their choices. In my opinion, it is crucial to investigate language variations in online customer reviews to better understand how customers build trust, experience satisfaction and make choices.

## Motivation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The motivation behind this research is based on the recognition of the important role language plays in online consumer environments. For companies striving to improve consumer trust, satisfaction, and decision-making, understanding the factors that contribute to sentiment in online reviews is critical. By examining the differences in language, we seek to understand how these elements interact and how companies can develop strategies to improve their online reputation. This research provides useful insights that can be used to better understand and influence how customers interact with online reviews.

## Method
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The research starts with carefully crafting search phrases in order to get pertinent and focused data from current IMDb online reviews.

The study applies sentiment analysis techniques to automatically classify reviews' sentiments through text analysis, natural language processing (NLP), and computational approaches. The emphasis is on determining users' attitudes toward various topics and differentiating between "positive" and "negative" feelings. Deliberately selected positive and negative phrases, such "bad," "excellent," and others, are analyzed in order to determine how these terms affect the overall emotional tone of reviews.

This technique not only seeks to identify common emotions found in IMDb reviews, but it also acts as a template for more general study findings. Through close examination of carefully chosen terms, the study aims to both understand how certain words affect feelings in online reviews and identify the underlying variables driving consumers' decision-making processes.
